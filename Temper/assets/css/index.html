								<h2>Meet James Ryan</h2>
								<p>Welcome to Temper, a culinary sanctuary born from the artistic vision of our founder, James Ryan. As an accomplished pastry chef, James has traversed the globe, honing his craft in the storied kitchens of Paris, France, and Milan, Italy. His insatiable passion for chocolate and the pursuit of crafting the most exquisite desserts has been the driving force behind the inception of this sweet haven.

									With an illustrious background that includes graduating from the renowned Culinary Institute of America and working alongside masterful artisans in Europe, James brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to every creation that graces our dessert emporium.
									
									For James, the allure of chocolate lies not only in its sumptuous taste but also in the challenge of fashioning breathtaking delights that captivate the senses. He believes that confectionery is an enchanting amalgamation of chemistry and creativity, where precision and flair intertwine to create masterpieces that leave lasting impressions.
									
									When he's not orchestrating stunning confections at Temper, James delights in the alchemy of baking, continuously pushing the boundaries of flavor and design in the cozy confines of his home kitchen. It is this unyielding curiosity and pursuit of perfection that infuses each dessert with a magical touch that sets Temper apart.
									
									In 2018, James returned to his cherished hometown of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, with an unwavering determination to share his passion and vision with the community he holds dear. Thus, Temper was bornâ€”a destination where chocolate takes center stage, and artistry meets indulgence.
									
									As you venture into our sweet realm, prepare to embark on a journey of flavor and wonder meticulously crafted by our passionate team under the discerning eye of James Ryan. From the finest ingredients sourced worldwide to the symphony of tastes that adorn every dessert, our creations embody the essence of chocolate craftsmanship.
									
									At Temper, we invite you to savor the fusion of skill and imagination, where chocolate becomes an art form and each dessert tells a story of passion, dedication, and the joy of the confectionery symphony that surrounds us. Join us in celebrating the enchanting world of chocolate, where every sweet creation is an ode to the artistry of James Ryan and the heartwarming embrace of our beloved Bryn Mawr community.</p>
